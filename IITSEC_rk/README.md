# Rosati-Kain I/ITSEC 2019 Future Leader Pavilion

In 2019, John mentored students from Rosati-Kain Catholic High School as they participated in the Future Leaders Pavilion at the I/ITSEC conference. This initiative is part of a STEM outreach program designed to inspire high school students to pursue science and technology fields.

The program challenges students nationwide to create a project, write a research paper, and present their findings at the conference. They interact directly with global industry leaders, gaining valuable insights and professional experience in a world-class setting.
